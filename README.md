# Tank Game in 3D
Taking inspiration from other games where you control a tank and move around a maze like map. Controlling a tank in the first person you would be pitted against other enemy AI tanks to win. 
- Start the game and move around, try to shoot the enemy.
- Player aims to get as many points as possible. 
- Once the player collides with the tank, game is over and can be restart.
- Player loses 1 live if gets hit by the enemy bullet. Player can then restart when no more lives is left.

## Notes
- The world is imported as an obj file which was created using Blender.
- There is a 2D minimap shown aside.
- The enemy tank's behaviour is very simple. It shoots randomly and it turns randomly. It also turns to other direction when it hits the wall.
- The game is not perfect and will have bugs when shooting and moving backwards.
