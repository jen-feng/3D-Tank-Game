## Notes
- The world is imported as an obj file which was created using Blender.
- The enemy tank's behaviour is very simple. It shoots randomly and it turns randomly. It also turns to other direction when it hits the wall.
- The game is not perfect and will have bugs when shooting and moving backwards.
